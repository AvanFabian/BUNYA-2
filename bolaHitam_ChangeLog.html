Here, we've removed the code for checking if the ball is at the end of the track, since it's not needed anymore with the
new curve. Instead, we move the track rectangular area diagonally upwards by subtracting half of the ball's speed from
its y coordinate (to make it follow the curve), and by adding the same amount to its x coordinate (to keep it moving
horizontally).

We also simplified the logic for detecting when the ball has reached the next point in the track, since the y coordinate
is now always decreasing. We just need to check whether the left or right edge of the rectangle has passed the x
coordinate of the next point.

Finally, we removed the code for handling the special cases when the ball is at the beginning or end of the track, since
they are no longer necessary. Instead, we reset the ball to the starting point if it reaches the end of the track, and
let it continue smoothly otherwise.

Next Change Plan :
- Add a smooth curve to the track, so that the ball moves in a more interesting way.
